# Travel Blog

I got the idea after travelling relatively a lot, to make a Travel Blog about my experiences and personal opinions so far.
Please note that it is not a travel guide and it does not contain any official information.
You can find the demo page under the following link:

## About me

My name is Melinda Bacs√≥, I started coding not a long time ago, using the help of online coding schools.
It is quite exciting, so I am planning to widen my knowledge as much as I can.
